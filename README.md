# Little Lemon Booking Website

This project was created during Meta's Coursera Front-End Development course. This website was the culmuniation of the Front-End Development Track.

This website showcased implementing a booking application on the Little Lemon Website. It was created with React Components to show an understanding of utilizing React for creating the website. This also features utilzing API calls.

Please note: the only functionality working on this website besides the design is the Reserve a Table function.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

[Halla24](https://github.com/Halla24)

1. Clone the repository: `git clone [repository URL]`
2. Install the dependencies: `npm install`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about running tests for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about deployment for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
